We are located in the [Department of Biological Sciences](http://www.biol.ttu.edu), [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu).

We study plant ecology and evolution with a focus on semi-arid and fire-prone ecosystems. Our work encompasses field, garden, and greenhouse studies; comparative methods; and theoretical models.

###Current interests and projects include:###

 - [Investigations into plant flammability and community assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/research/projects/#flam)
 - [The interaction of plant fire response strategies, temperature and drought]({{site.baseurl}}/research/projects/#veg-shifts)
 - [Implications of climate change for plants]({{site.baseurl}}/research/projects/#veg-shifts)
 - [The evolution and ecological significance of fire adapted traits]({{site.baseurl}}/research/projects/#evol)

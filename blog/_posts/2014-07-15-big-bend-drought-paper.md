Just out in PeerJ: [Plant dieback under exceptional drought driven by elevation, not by plant traits, in Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA. Elizabeth F. Waring, and Dylan W. Schwilk 2014](https://peerj.com/articles/477/)

This paper presents data collected entirely during field trips for my Ecological Strategies of Plants course (Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 classes). Lizz Waring took the course in 2011 and wrote this paper.

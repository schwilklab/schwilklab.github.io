I am currently accepting both Master's and Ph.D. students. I have funded RA-ships available.

Ph.D. students will work with me to develop an independent research project that is creative, novel, and meets their professional goals.

For a Master's student, the dissertation project likely will be of more limited scope, for reasons related to the shorter duration of a Master's degree. A Master's degree is ideal for exploring interests, building skills, and practicing science under more guidance than would be allowed in a Ph.D. program.

Interested students should read several of my papers and the material on this web site to determine if our interests match. It is not necessary that students know their dissertation topic at the time of application, but I do expect students to have an idea of types of questions and systems that interest them. Eligible students should also apply for an NSF graduate research fellowship.

### Application Procedures ###

Email me a Curriculum Vitae and be sure to include:

 1. statement of your research interests and career goals
 2. academic and professional accomplishments (degrees, GPA, GRE scores, awards, fellowships, publications, grants, presentations at professional meetings, jobs)
 3. summary of your past research experiences
 4. names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of 3 references


I will contact you for discussion and you will then need to apply to the graduate programs in both the <a href="http://www.biol.ttu.edu">Department of Biological Sciences</a> and in the<a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/gradschool/admissions/"> Graduate School at Texas Tech University</a>.

The official departmental application deadlines are February 1 for the following Fall Semester, but prospective students must have all application materials to me by mid-January in order to be considered for acceptance and scholarships. Please contact me any time, however, as rolling admissions are possible.
